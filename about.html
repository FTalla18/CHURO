My best friend told me about Turo and I found this wonderful man right here. He made my first time experience easy and accommodating. I rate him 10/10 and would recommend him to any one of my family members to him. He was welcoming, nice, very easy going, and respectful. I met him at his residence and he handed me the keys. Told me to take my pictures and read the rules. Long as you respect the rules of the vehicle you will be fine. When I first entered the vehicle I was in love. I immediately respected the truck like it was my own, told the kids to respect it, and any of my visitors. The truck gas tank was full and the car was clean. The truck smelled good for a whole week straight. He made my Turo experience smooth, easy, and perfect. I was stressed because my car went out and I have it in the shop for fixing. I was able to make it back and forth for work because of this young man. I absolutely adore you and appreciate your hospitality. I will be back. Thank you again.”</blockquote>
