   CHURO — business knowledge base
   Single source of truth for the website AND the chatbot.
   Update a car's status, prices or photos here and every
   tile, calculator and chatbot answer follows.

   status:
     "available" – can be rented, rented-to-own, or bought
     "soon"      – coming soon: shown with prices, not bookable yet
     "rto"       – being purchased by a customer through Rent-to-Own (not offered)

   Prices: a number, or a [min, max] range. Ranges resolve to one
   price per day (same for every visitor that day) and change daily.

Either way it's returned at the end of your rental, minus any citations, tolls or fees incurred during your trip. Weekly rentals require 2 proofs of address.",
    payment: "Pay online through our booking form (card), or with cash, Apple Pay, Venmo, Chime or Zelle.",

    pickup: "Pick-up and return are in Sarasota, FL 34234 (free). Prefer delivery? We deliver within 15 miles of 34234 for $140.",
    travel: "Drive anywhere in Florida. Cars are GPS-tracked and are not allowed outside Florida.",
    mileage: "Each car includes 200 miles per day, which is plenty: most renters never get close.",

    issues: "If anything goes wrong during your rental, contact us right away and we'll resolve it as quickly as possible.",
    rideshare: "Yes — you can drive for Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and other gig apps on a Rent-to-Own car. Just nothing illegal: illegal use is a default under the agreement.",
    cleanliness: "Every car is cleaned and sanitized before each rental and fully inspected for defects. We take pre- and post-trip photos every time, so there's clear documentation when the car comes back.",
    cash: "Buy outright with cash: bring the full amount in cash, we sign the clean title over to you, and you take it to the DMV for your registration and license plate.",
    rto: "Rent-to-Own is a low-stakes way into car ownership for people tired of renting week after week. No credit check. Every Rent-to-Own starts with a one-week rental: it shows you can make payments on time, and lets you get a feel for the car — anything you notice that needs fixing during that week, tell us and we'll fix it before signing. Then we meet at MIDFLORIDA to sign and notarize the agreement, you make the down payment and show proof of insurance. You pay weekly or every two weeks until the car is paid off (12 months max) and take over ongoing maintenance. No monthly payment plans.",
    rtoInsurance: "Two options. (1) Use CHURO's insurance: $60/week added to your payment. (2) Use your own policy: list CHURO as lienholder/loss payee and additional insured. Because the car stays titled in CHURO's name until it's paid off, Florida law requires us to keep at least minimum liability coverage on it, so $97/month is added to your payments for that coverage.",
